# Refig
Refig is a flexible configuration reading, writing, and caching library that works through `Promise` objects, traditional callbacks, and synchronously.  It parses information from local configurations, global configurations, and `package.json` (if available).  It defaults to `JSON` parsing and serializing, but you can set your own, as long as they follow the `JSON` interface (like `CSON`).

### The Problem
Configurations in modern applications can become wide-spread through a system and multiple files.  You can global configs, local configs, and even `package.json` configs.  With a widespread system like this, it can be difficult to manage all the different locations a entry could be listed.

### The Solution
Refig provides a simple interface to source files from multiple locations in one line, this makes it easy to concatenate any configurations in a given scenario into one parsed object.
